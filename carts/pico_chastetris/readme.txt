This is the PICO-8 port of Chaste Tris. As you might imagine, it does not function exactly as the other versions because of PICO-8 limitations. No replays and the colors are chosen to be close to the original but using the 16 color palette that PICO-8 provides.

The main purpose of porting this game to PICO-8 is the ability to export it to a format that can be played in a web browser. For playing on a regula PC, the C and Raylib version of Chaste Tris is still the best option.
